# React + Vite + Vercel Best Practices

You are an expert in React, Vite, and Vercel development.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Use explicit return types for functions.
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
- Use clean, semantic HTML5 elements.

## Performance Optimization
- Use `React.memo` only when necessary for expensive computations.
- Implement lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for large components.
- Optimize images using proper formats (WebP) and sizing.

## File Structure
- Keep components small and focused.
- Group related files (styles, tests, component) in feature folders.
- Use absolute imports (configure alias `@/` in vite.config.js if needed).

## Vercel Deployment
- Ensure `vite.config.js` is properly configured for production.
- Use "dist" as the output directory.
- Always check build status before pushing (`npm run build`).

## Lightning Network Integration (Specific to this user)
- Use `react-qr-code` for QR generation.
- Ensure Lightning Addresses don't have the `lightning:` prefix for compatibility if creating raw strings, but use URI schemes correctly for links.
